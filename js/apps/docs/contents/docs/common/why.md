# Why use Canary?

## Tiny components that works anywhere

`Canary` use [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so browsers know how to render it.

<SizeChart 
title="Bundle size (Uncompressed)"
:labels="Object.keys(packages)"
:values="Object.values(packages)"
/>

## Modular and open-source

We're fully [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary), and encourage anyone to contribute to our UI components. Also, we put a lot of effort into making the **core parts of `Canary` as modular as possible**.
