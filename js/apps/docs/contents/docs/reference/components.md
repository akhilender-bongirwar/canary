If you find something missing here, there's three places to fix it:

1. [`CEM.vue`](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary/blob/main/js/apps/docs/components/CEM.vue) for rendering the data.
2. [Each component's source code](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary/tree/main/js/packages/web/src/components) for adding the missing data.
3. [`vite.config.ts`](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary/blob/main/js/packages/web/vite.config.ts) for adding the missing component.
