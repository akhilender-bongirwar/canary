# Manual

Setting up Canary should takes `< 3min`.

## 1. Create a project

Only `name` is required. You can obtain `project_key` here.

After creating a project, click `Back to home`.

## 2. Create sources

Here, we are configuring `Webpage` source. Other sources like `GitHub issue` should be even easier.
`Fetching & indexing` may take a while, but **it will be done in the background even if you close the tab.**
