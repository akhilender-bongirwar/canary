# Why use Canary?

## Modular and open-source

We're fully [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary), and encourage anyone to contribute to our UI components. Also, we put a lot of effort into making the **core parts of `Canary` as modular as possible**.

## Attention to detail, for technical docs

## Tiny components that works anywhere

`Canary` use [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so browsers know how to render it.

<SizeChart 
title="Bundle size (Uncompressed)"
:labels="Object.keys(packages)"
:values="Object.values(packages)"
/>

## Seamless integrations

We currently support [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/). Since Canary uses [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), it can easily be integrated with any other framework.

**Not only that, but we support both [`Local`](/docs/local/intro) and [`Cloud`](/docs/cloud/intro) options.**
This means you can quickly add search functionality to your docs, without setting up an account or paying anything.

If you decide to use `Canary Cloud` for more features, you can easily migrate.

```html-vue
<canary-root framework="docusaurus">
  <canary-provider-pagefind> // [!code --]
  <canary-provider-cloud api-key="KEY" api-base="https://cloud.getcanary.dev"> // [!code ++]
    <!-- Rest of the code -->
  </canary-provider-cloud> // [!code ++]
  </canary-provider-pagefind> // [!code --]
</canary-root>
```
