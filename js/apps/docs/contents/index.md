# What is Canary?

`Canary` provides UI primitives and self-hostable infrastructure for building **modern search-bar** for techincal documentation.

## Search-as-you-type, augmented with AI

It's been a while since we started seeing blazing fast search results. But still, it's hard to find the exact information **unless you know the exact keyword.**

Also, for large documentations, users often need to go though multiple pages and sections to get questions answered.

`Canary` use keyword based search by default to provide fast search results, but falls back to AI-powered search if it can not find any results or user is asking rather than searching.

## Tiny components that works anywhere

Canary use [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so browsers know how to render it.

:values="Object.values(packages)"

## Modular and open-source

We're fully [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary), and encourage anyone to contribute to our UI components. Also, we put a lot of effort into making the **core parts of üê§Canary as modular as possible**.
