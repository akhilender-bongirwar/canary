title: Hosted vs Self-host

> Note that this is only relevant if you are using `canary-provider-cloud` component.

## Hosted

[cloud.getcanary.dev](https://cloud.getcanary.dev) is best place to get started for most users.

## Self-host

We have a [**Railway template**](https://railway.app/template/mn9WJT?referralCode=IQ76H8) that you can use to deploy your own instance of Canary.
